# Healthcare-Analysis-Using-ML



Project Description:
The "Healthcare Analysis using Machine Learning" project is a dynamic exploration of healthcare data, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. This study incorporates a range of features, including Patient_ID, Online_Follower, LinkedIn_Shared, Twitter_Shared, Facebook_Shared, Income, Education_Score, Age, First_Interaction, City_Type, and Employer_Category.

The primary objective of this project is to harness the power of machine learning algorithms to derive meaningful insights into patient engagement and healthcare interactions. By analyzing the impact of online presence, socio-demographic factors, and first interaction details, the project aims to uncover patterns that can inform healthcare providers and policymakers about effective strategies for patient outreach and engagement.

The inclusion of features such as income, education score, and employer category allows for a nuanced understanding of the socio-economic factors influencing healthcare engagement. Through predictive modeling and pattern recognition, the project strives to contribute valuable knowledge to the healthcare domain, aiding in the development of targeted healthcare interventions and personalized patient care strategies.

This project stands at the intersection of healthcare, data science, and machine learning, with the goal of improving patient outcomes and fostering a more data-informed approach to healthcare delivery.
